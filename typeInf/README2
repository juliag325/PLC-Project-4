# Project 4: Type Inference in Prolog**

Members: Sindy Wu and Julia Aiello 

# Running Our Code

1. cd into typeInf directory. 
2. run *swipl* in terminal.
3. Load code with [typeInf].
4. Can ask questions such as typeExp(+(X,Y), T). 


# Running Unit tests

1. While in *swipl*, 

    A. Run all tests: 

    consult("typeInf.plt"), run_tests(). 

    B. Specific tests: 

    consult("typeInf.plt"), run_tests(typeInf:testname). 

    (Can optionally trace by using **trace** keyword). 



## Tasks that were implemented: 
    1. Basic functions (ftype)
    2. statement types (typeStatements)
        a. global variables 
        b. global function definitions 
        c. computing expressions 
        d. if statements 
        f. for statements 
        g. code blocks. (using ;)
